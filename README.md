PatentLabeling
==============

This code was developed as part of the USPTO Algorithm Challenge, a competition organized by NASA and hosted by TopCoder.com with the purpose of digitalizing patents for the US Patent and Trademark Office.

In the Problem Statement section there is a brief description of the problem this code try to solve.

You can find more information on the competition here(http://community.topcoder.com/ntl/) and the full problem statement here(http://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&rd=15027&pm=11645). Note that you should be a TopCoder member to be able to read the later.


Problem Statement
-----------------

For this problem a patent page composed by one or more figures together with a textual description are provided. Each figure in the patent is the image of a section of a patented system. Furthermore, each figure has exactly one title and a certain number of labels (possibly none).

You may refer to the training-set directory as well as to the link to the problem statement above for further information regard the input.

The code must implement two methods: the former must return the best bounding box for each figure presents in a patent page together with its title, the latter must return the best bounding box for each label on the patent page together with the its text.
